# UnoNet
**UnoNet** is a **simple**, **TCP-based** networking solution that's aimed toward beginners.
While making UnoNet, I focused on making it simple and easy to understand and tried to look in the eyes of a beginner.

## Project status
**.NET Version:** 4.8.1

As of now, the project is being tested in the unity game engine.
Since Unity supports only 4. X, the project, for now, will stay at 4.8.1 and may be upgraded to support other platforms in the future
